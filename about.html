      <p>Hi, my name is Ramzee Christiel and I am a third-year undergraduate student at the Ilinois Institute of technology (IIT).</p>
      <p>I am currently in the ITM program with expectations to graduate Spring 2020.</p>
      <p>So far I've learned basics in web development, programming in Java, as well as how to effectively</p>
      <p>manage projects, to just name a few things. I am currently working as property manager for a company</p>
      <p>that I co-founded. we're looking to incorporate by the end of 2018. Working in construction and property managment</p>
      <p>for 15 years has provided me the necessary skills to maintain the integrity of my own property, and</p>
      <p>I can honestly say that I not only take pride in doing quality work on my on plcae, it's the same with all of my clients.</p> 
      <p>The customer should always be completely satisfied. I came to IIT as part of a redirection plan from pursuing a major in</p>
      <p>business management to attempt something a bit more challenging, and what an awesome challenge it is! Designing websites is</p>
      <p>not that different to building a home and then designing it, one of my personal passions. My oldest brother was the first of</p>
      <p>my siblings to graduate college obtaining a Master's degree in Computer Science, and I plan to match or surpass him. I had the</p>
      <p>opportunity to learn hands-on at Chicago General Contractors, which is owned by a master craftsman who taught me everything about</p>
      <p>plumbing, carpentry, heating and cooling, as well as electrical systems.</p>
